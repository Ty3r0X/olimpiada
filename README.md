# This repo has nothing of value, so shoo

A bit of backstory, in 13th of March 2023 I wanted to give the simulation of the National Olympiad of Informatics a shot, and failed miserably. Attached is what I have worked in the time limit of 3 hours. The program was not able to solve the problem (I think I made some last minute changes that further broke the program). The reason I decided to post it is so potentially future me can look back and chuckle :), or maybe a lame excuse to make a repo :P.

The PDF contains the problem. Whoever gets to solve it I'll specify their repo here.

Thanks!
